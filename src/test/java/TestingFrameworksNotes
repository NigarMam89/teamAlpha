It can be used for unit, integration, system and end-to-end testing - different level of testing;
QA can participate in the three levels of testing: integration, system and acceptance testing;
There are other types of testing such as performance, securiy, usability testing and etc.

it has extra ways to configure and write test methods;
the main feature of TestNG is Java annotation: like @Test
