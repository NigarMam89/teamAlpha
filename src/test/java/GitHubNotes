How to collaborate on a project using GitHub workflow (branch-based workflow);

1. Team lead creates a project, adds a gitignore file, starts a new git project (VSC-> Enable version control - Git)
and creates a commit and pushes it to a remote repository and gives a push access to other team members (add them as a
collaborators)


2. other team members clone the repository
3. everyone needs to create a new branch to avoid working in the main branch
4. add new changes in your own branch, commit the change, and push the branch to remote
5. create a pull request for the branch code to be reviewed by others
6. Once the code is reviews, the reviewer closes the pull requesr and merges the branch and deletes the branch
7. The owner of the branch should pull the changes from remote's main local main
8. the owner of the branch should also delete it locally

// remember: To avoid merge conflicts, pull the changes fro the remote before working on
